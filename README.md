# Api_pokedex

This project is was my training of api consume with angular, the visual is pretty simple since i was really focused on the api and route treatment.

## Development server

run 'npm i' to install dependencies

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
